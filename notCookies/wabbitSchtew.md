**Ingredients**  
3 pounds rabbit, cut into stew sized pieces  
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  
1/4 cup grapeseed oil  
3 tablespoons butter  
1 cup celery, diced  
2 cups diced carrots  
2 onions, finely diced  
Salt  
Freshly ground black pepper  
3 bay leaves  
6 cups water  
4 cups red wine  
4 medium-sized potatoes, diced  
1/2 cup sliced sauteed mushrooms  

Instructions:
Using half the flour (3/4 cup) coat the pieces of rabbit, shaking off any excess.  
Heat the oil and butter in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, and brown the floured rabbit on all sides.  
Add the celery, carrots, onions, salt, pepper, bay leaves, 6 cups water and red wine, and stew for about 2 hours.  

Add the potatoes 45 minutes into the stewing process. 

Once the rabbit and all the vegetables are cooked, use some water to form a paste with the remaining 3/4 cup flour. 
Stir the flour mixture into the pot as a thickener.

Add the already sauteed mushrooms to the stew and allow to simmer for about 10 minutes. 
Adjust seasonings, if necessary, and serve.
