Banana Bread
=============

original recipe from Great Grandma Alma Leona (Clever) Roberts  

Combine:  
3/4 cup sugar  
1/4 cup coconut oil (can substitute 1/4 cup butter)  
Mix thoroughly, until the mixture is of an even consistancy  

Mix in:
1 egg  
3 tablespoons sour milk (1 teaspoon vinegar in a container, then add enough milk to make 3 tablespoons total)  
1.5 cups mashed banana  
Mix to an even consistancy  

Mix in:  
2 cups flour  
1/2 teaspoon baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
1/4 tsp salt  

Optional:  
1/2 cup nuts  
1/2 cup chocolate chips  

Grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan.  
May optionally line bottom of pan with baking parchment paper or waxed paper.  
Two smaller pans, or even muffin tins may be used.  

For a 8x4 loaf pan, bake 55-60 min at 350 degrees.  
Test with a toothpick inserted into center top at the 50 minute mark.  
If gooey, bake at least 10 min before testing again.  
If just a few crumbs stick to toothpick, turn off oven and leave in another 5 min.  

Remove from oven, cool 15-30 min on wire rack before carefully removing from pan.  
If bread is sticking, run a smooth butter knife along the edges to un-stick.
