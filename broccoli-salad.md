BROCCOLI SALAD
==============

##Not a cookie...but delicious anyway##

##Ingredients:##

###Group A:###
* 3 heads **broccoli** 
* 1 pound **bacon**, cooked and crumbled
* 2 cups **shredded cheddar cheese**

###Group B:###
* 2 cups **mayo**
* 1 cup **sugar**
* 1 splash **white vinegar**

##Directions:##
1. Combine all of Group A in a bowl
2. Combine all of Group B in a different bowl; stir well  
  2a. Vinegar should be added until the mixture becomes tart, not sweet. The easiest way to tell when the proportions are correct is to taste it before adding any vinegar, and then add vinegar until it no longer tastes like that.
3. Pour Mix B onto Mix A; stir well
4. *(Optional)* Refrigerate overnight for best flavor; stir before serving
